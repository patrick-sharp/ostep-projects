# What's in the src folder
The src folder is assumed to contain the full source code of xv6.
I only committed the files that I changed, so you'll have to get the rest of the source code 
and put it in src.
The repo I used is called "xv6-public" on github (https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public)

# General xv6 notes
The actual code for syscalls is separated into two files:
sysproc.c 
sysfile.c

All \*.asm and \*.sym files are build artifacts.
Vectors.S is a build artifact, it is generated by vectors.pl.

T_SYSCALL is 64

# Useful GDB commands

info locals (print local variables)
info variables (print variables defined outside functions)
info break (print all breakpoints)
b main (breakpoint at main function)
break syscall.c:140 if num == 5 || num == 22 (breakpoint for catching specific syscalls)
del \<#\> (delete breakpoint number \<#\>)
c continue (run until breakpoint)
n next (step over a function call)
s step (step into a function call)
ni next machine instruction (step over a function call)
si step machine instruction (step into a function call)
finish fin (step out of a function call)
print \<var\> (print the value of the variable \<var\>)
ptype \<var\> (print the type of the variable \<var\>)
frame (print the current line and what function/file it's in)
layout asm (switch to view where the current asm instruction + context is shown above the cli)


# Useful things to look at in gdb
idt (array of 256 gatedesc structs)
syscalls (array of syscall functions)
